<br>

Welcome to **MisterLister**! Born from my _**P**ersonal **A**pp **C**reation **I**nitiative_ (fancy name for a hobby project ü§ì), this is a clean, minimalist table editor that turns your filenames into formatted, printable lists.

![MisterLister main interface](https://github.com/Sh-ui/MisterLister/blob/main/assets/example_images/mister_lister_main_ui.png)


## üéØ Purpose & Scope

MisterLister started as my personal solution for a very specific need: turning Windows filenames into organized, printable lists without the usual hassles. While it's currently tailored to my particular workflow and filename formatting preferences, it's built with love and an eye toward future expansion.

It is not a general-purpose tool (at the moment), it only works with filenames that follow a strict structure:
```python
# all caps needed*   dob*       date*
LASTNAME FIRSTNAME MMDDYY ITEM MMDDYY
```

If your files don't match this format, the program will not function as expected. While it is tailored to my personal workflow, others may find it useful with modifications.

- Customizable font size and row spacing for your filename displays
